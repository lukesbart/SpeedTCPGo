# SpeedTCP Go
This project is a rewrite of my SpeedTCP server from C# to Go.

## Motivation
* The C# version of my server was very poorly written
* I am in the process of learning Go and a project with concurrency and asynchronous operators would be good for my Go experience and my programming experience in general
